# What Senyo Said - Frontend Project

## Project Overview
This is the frontend for "What Senyo Said" - a wiki-style application to collect and display interesting phrases, quotes, and sayings from Senyo, a colleague in the office.

## Project Features
- **Main Page**: Displays a collection of Senyo's sayings
- **Social Media Card Format**: Each saying is displayed as a card with:
  - The saying/quote text
  - Timestamp of when it was added
- **Add Quote Button**: Allows users to add new Senyo quotes
- **Simple UI**: Clean, straightforward interface for browsing and adding quotes

## Technical Stack
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS (based on components.json)
- shadcn/ui components

## Development Notes
- This is frontend-only; backend integration will be handled separately
- Focus on creating an intuitive, social media-like experience for viewing quotes
- Keep the UI simple and clean to let Senyo's wisdom shine through
